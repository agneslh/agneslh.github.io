## Education and Professional Experience
I am a environmental geoscientist focused on emerging contaminants in groundwater and soil. For the past 6 years I have worked in environmental consulting specializing in PFAS contamintion. I have a masters in environmental geoscience and a bachelors in geological science and math. 
## About Me
Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. Currently residing in upstate New York with my partner and two cats. Hobbies include hiking, fashion, rap, jazz, and finding good vegetarian food.
## Earth Data Science Goals
I want to look at co contaminants that are often seen along side with PFAS and use that to further understand environmental forensics and PFAS fate and transport. I am also interested in looking at soil and groundwater contaminate analytical data on a larger scale and learning to apply data science to solve and enhance understanindgs of fate and transport. Finally, I want to look at remote sensing to help understand contaminant fate and transport - especially groundwater/surface water interactions.
